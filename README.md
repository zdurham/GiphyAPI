# GiphyAPI
An app made for the UNC Coding Bootcamp.

Users can search for GIFs using buttons on the left menu. To add a button, type in the button content to the bar below and press submit. That button will then appear with the rest, and the user can select that to search.

Gifs will initially display as 'paused.' Clicking on a gif will activate it. Each GIF includes a small rating in the top right corner of the display area.
